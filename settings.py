API INSTRUCTIONS


Go to https://console.developers.google.com/apis


Create a project -- call it whatever you want. It will take a little bit of time.

Google will notify you when it's completed. Then in the API search box,
search for custom search and enable the custom search API.

You may see this message:
This API is enabled, but you can't use it in your project until you create credentials.
Click "Go to Credentials" to do this now (strongly recommended).

So, click the button.

In the question from "Where will you be calling the API from? Choose Other UI (e.g. Windows, CLI tool).

It will recommend you create a Server API key. Do that. If you want to be extremely secure, you can
tell Google to only allow API calls from certain IP addresses. Make sure you know how to find out your IP address. You don't
have to do that though.

Click Create API key.

Then copy and paste the API key. It should look like this: iwogviojwqregjiowqlkasdio (note, this isn't a key, it's gibberish)
Paste it below assigned to the variable API_KEY.
